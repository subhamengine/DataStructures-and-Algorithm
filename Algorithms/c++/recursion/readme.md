*All Recursion concepts explained and questions practiced*
<h1>C++ Recursion</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we will learn about recursive function in C++ and its working with the help of examples.

A function that calls itself is known as a recursive function. And, this technique is known as recursion.</p>
<h2>Working of Recursion in C++</h2>

The figure below shows how recursion works by calling itself over and over again.

<p>The recursion continues until some condition is met.

To prevent infinite recursion, if...else statement (or similar approach) can be used where one branch makes the recursive call and the other doesn't.</p>

<h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursion</h2>
<h3>Below are the pros and cons of using recursion in C++.</h3>

<p>Advantages of C++ Recursion
It makes our code shorter and cleaner.
Recursion is required in problems concerning data structures and advanced algorithms, such as Graph and Tree Traversal.
Disadvantages of C++ Recursion
It takes a lot of stack space compared to an iterative program.
It uses more processor time.
It can be more difficult to debug compared to an equivalent iterative program.</p>
