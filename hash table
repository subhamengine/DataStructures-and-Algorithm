Data Structure and Algorithms - Hash Table

Hash Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.

Thus, it becomes a data structure in which insertion and search operations are very fast irrespective of the size of the data. Hash Table uses an array as a storage medium and uses hash technique to generate an index where an element is to be inserted or is to be located from.

Hashing
Hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array. We're going to use modulo operator to get a range of key values. Consider an example of hash table of size 20, and the following items are to be stored. Item are in the (key,value) format.
Hash table is a data structure that represents data in the form of key-value pairs. Each key is mapped to a value in the hash table. The keys are used for indexing the values/data. A similar approach is applied by an associative array. Data is represented in a key value pair with the help of keys as shown in the figure below.

4	4	4 % 20 = 4	4
5	12	12 % 20 = 12	12

8	13	13 % 20 = 13	13

Linear Probing
As we can see, it may happen that the hashing technique is used to create an already used index of the array. In such a case, we can search the next empty location in the array by looking into the next cell until we find an empty cell. This technique is called linear probing.

2	2	2 % 20 = 2	2	2
3	42	42 % 20 = 2	2	3
4	4	4 % 20 = 4	4	4
5	12	12 % 20 = 12	12	12
6	14	14 % 20 = 14	14	14
7	17	17 % 20 = 17	17	17
8	13	13 % 20 = 13	13	13

Basic Operations
Following are the basic primary operations of a hash table.

Search − Searches an element in a hash table.

Insert − inserts an element in a hash table.

delete − Deletes an element from a hash table.

DataItem
Define a data item having some data and key, based on which the search is to be conducted in a hash table.

struct DataItem {
   int data;
   int key;
};
Hash Method
Define a hashing method to compute the hash code of the key of the data item.

int hashCode(int key){
   return key % SIZE;
}
Search Operation
Whenever an element is to be searched, compute the hash code of the key passed and locate the element using that hash code as index in the array. Use linear probing to get the element ahead if the element is not found at the computed hash code.

Example
struct DataItem *search(int key) {
   //get the hash
   int hashIndex = hashCode(key);
	
   //move in array until an empty
   while(hashArray[hashIndex] != NULL) {
	
      if(hashArray[hashIndex]->key == key)
         return hashArray[hashIndex];
			
      //go to next cell
      ++hashIndex;
		
      //wrap around the table
      hashIndex %= SIZE;
   }

   return NULL;        
}
Insert Operation
Whenever an element is to be inserted, compute the hash code of the key passed and locate the index using that hash code as an index in the array. Use linear probing for empty location, if an element is found at the computed hash code.

Example
void insert(int key,int data) {
   struct DataItem *item = (struct DataItem*) malloc(sizeof(struct DataItem));
   item->data = data;  
   item->key = key;     

   //get the hash 
   int hashIndex = hashCode(key);

   //move in array until an empty or deleted cell
   while(hashArray[hashIndex] != NULL && hashArray[hashIndex]->key != -1) {
      //go to next cell
      ++hashIndex;
		
      //wrap around the table
      hashIndex %= SIZE;
   }
	
   hashArray[hashIndex] = item;        
}
Delete Operation
Whenever an element is to be deleted, compute the hash code of the key passed and locate the index using that hash code as an index in the array. Use linear probing to get the element ahead if an element is not found at the computed hash code. When found, store a dummy item there to keep the performance of the hash table intact.

Example
struct DataItem* delete(struct DataItem* item) {
   int key = item->key;

   //get the hash 
   int hashIndex = hashCode(key);

   //move in array until an empty 
   while(hashArray[hashIndex] !=NULL) {
	
      if(hashArray[hashIndex]->key == key) {
         struct DataItem* temp = hashArray[hashIndex]; 
			
         //assign a dummy item at deleted position
         hashArray[hashIndex] = dummyItem; 
         return temp;
      } 
		
      //go to next cell
      ++hashIndex;
		
      //wrap around the table
      hashIndex %= SIZE;
   }  
	
   return NULL;        
}
