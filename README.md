### Why companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google focuses on Data Structures and Algorithms

If you’re preparing for a tech interview of any big tech company like Adobe, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc. – most probably, you would have known about the importance of Data Structures and Algorithms to crack these interviews. Yes, most of the interviews for technical roles in these companies are focused on measuring the **Data Structures and Algorithms** knowledge of the candidates.

There are multiple reasons why **Product Based Companies** place so much emphasis on Data Structures and Algorithms as stated below:

1. Data Structures and Algorithms demonstrate the **problem-solving ability** of a candidate. There is no room to craft elaborate stories and this means that either the candidate can solve the problem or they can’t.
2. Questions based on Data Structures and Algorithms can be **scaled up or down** according to the knowledge level of the candidate. This means that a variety of candidates can be tested using roughly the same problems.
3. Data Structures and Algorithms are used to test the **analytical skills** of the candidates as they are a useful tool to pick out the underlying algorithms in real-world problems and solve them efficiently.
4. Data Structures and Algorithms are the **fundamentals** of Software Development. They remain the same no matter what new technology is used and that puts the focus on the problem rather than the technology in the interview process.

<h1 align="center">Steps to post your solutions</h1>

### In order to sumbit the solution to the respective questions, you need to follow the following steps.

1. Firstly, you need to fork the repository **Competitive-Programming-and-DSA**.
2. Every week we'll be posting 6-7 questions inside the **/Questions** folder inside the **questions.md** file.
   These questions will be classified into different levels of difficulties.
3. In order to submit the solution to the respective questions, you need to create a file for that particular question inside the **/solutions** folder. Say, you want to post the solution to question 1 in java, create a file named **solution_1.java**. The naming convention is **solution_number.(your_language)** . Obviously, you can write in the programming language of your choice.
4. Now, since you have done your changes, next step would be to commit them.
4. Lastly, you have to create a pull request. Keep base repo as the CODE++ original repo and the head repo as your forked one. Give a suitable name to the PR. Finally click on Create Pull Request.
5. The solution with the best time and space complexity will be merged into the original repository.


**Important** - Every now and then, usually before creating a pull request to post your solutions, please create a reverse pull request(i,e, keep base repo as your forked one and the head repo as the CODE++ original repo) so that your forked repo gets updated wrt original repo. Or, you can simply click on Fetch upstream in your forked repo.
